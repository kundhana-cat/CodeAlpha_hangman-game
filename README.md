ABSTRACT





This program is a simple Hangman game implemented using Python. The application randomly selects a word from a predefined list and allows the user to guess the word one letter at a time. The program displays
underscores for unguessed letters and reveals the correct letters as the user makes correct guesses. The user is given a limited number of wrong attempts, which are counted and displayed after each incorrect guess.
The game continues until the user successfully guesses all the letters in the word or exhausts the maximum allowed wrong guesses. This program demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, lists, string
operations, and random number generation in Python, making it suitable for beginners and educational purposes.





FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM:



- Uses random word selection to make the game different each time.

- Allows user interaction by accepting letter guesses from the keyboard.

- Displays the current progress of the word using underscores for unguessed letters.

- Reveals correctly guessed letters in their proper positions.

- Keeps track of wrong guesses made by the user.

- Limits the number of incorrect attempts to 6 chances.

- Displays the remaining attempts after each wrong guess.

- Automatically checks for win condition when all letters are guessed.
